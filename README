Demo
====

    There is a running demo at <http://tale.gg>.  Click
    "Play" (which will be focused when you load the page, so
    you can just press "Enter").  Once you're in the game,
    you can type commands like, but not limited to, the
    names of exits in your room.


Build Your Own World
====================

    As you travel the world, the game server fetches
    JSON format files that describe each room.
    These files can be placed anywhere on the web,
    like <http://tale.gg/world/dya.json>.  They
    look like this:

    {
        "name": "A Dark Room",
        "description": "It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.",
        "image": "darkness.png",
        "exits": {
            "north": {
                "href": "old-man.json"
            },
            "south": {
                "href": "wumpus.json"
            }
        }
    }

    You can create your own and travel to your world by
    using the "teleport" command when you play
    <http://tale.gg/>, or run your own instance of
    the Tale server.
