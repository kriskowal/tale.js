    "description": "You spy from here the Three perilous Ice Bergs of Austra, in their semi-fix&egrave;d formation from the north-west to the south-east.  On the pinacle of Centerberg is the Teal candy-striped Sinister Lighthouse, capital of crafty Magust Australis. The salty waters of Austra form a frozen desert ring, save where they mix with the warm waters of Occia to the north, and the warm airs of Oria to the west.",
